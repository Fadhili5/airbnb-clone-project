## PROJECT GOALS
 Throughout this project I aim to:
- Master collaborative team workflows using GitHub
- Deepen my understanding of backend architecture and database design principles.
- Implement advanced security measures for API development.
- Gain proficiency in designing and managing CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployment.
- Strengthen my ability to document and plan complex software project effectively.
- Develop an understanding of integrating technologies like Django, MySQL and GraphQL in a unified ecosystem.

## DATABASE DESIGN
### Entities and Key Fields
1. User
    - `user_id`: Unique identifier for the user.
    - `username`: Login credential for the user.
    - `email`: Contact information.
    - `password_hash`: Securely stored user password.
    - `profile_info`: Additional user information.
2. Property
    - `property_id`: Unique identifier for the property.
    - `owner_id`: Foreign key linking to the User entity.
    - `address`: The location of the property.
    - `description`: Description of the property.
    - `price_per_night`: Cost to rent the property per night.
3. Booking
    - `booking_id`: Unique identifier for the booking.
    - `user_id`: Foreign key linking to the User entity.
    - `property_id`: Foreign key linking to the Property entity.
    - `start_date`: Check-in date.
    - `end_date`: Check-out date.
4. Review
    - `review_id`: Unique identifier for the review.
    - `user_id`: Foreign key linking to the User entity.
    - `property_id`: Foreign key linking to the Property entity.
    - `rating`: Rating given by the user.
    - `comment`: Review comment.
5. Payment
    - `payment_id`: Unique identifier for the payment.
    - `booking_id`: Foreign key linking to the Booking entity.
    - `amount`: Amount paid.
    - `payment_date`: Date when payment was made.
    - `status`: Status of the payment (e.g., completed, pending).


### Entity relationships
- A user can have multiple properties.
- A property can have multiple bookings.
- A booking belongs to one user and one property
- A review belongs to one User and one property
- A payment is associated with one booking.

## FEATURE BREAKDOWN
1. API Documentation
    *OpenAPI Standard:* The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
    *Django REST Framework:* Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
    *GraphQL:* Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.
2. User Authentication
    + Endpoints: `/users/, /users/{user_id}/`
    + Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
3. Property Management
    + Endpoints: `/properties/, /properties/{property_id}/`
    + Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
4. Booking System
    + Endpoints: `/bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/`
    + Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
5. Payment Processing
    + Endpoints: `/payments/`
    + Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
6. Review System
    + Endpoints: `/reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/`
    + Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.
7. Database Optimizations
    - *Indexing:* Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
    - *Caching:* Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

## API SECURITY
- **Authentication:** I will experiment with methods like OAuth or JWTs to verify user identity.
- **Authorization:** Implementing role based access control to ensure users can only access allowed resources.
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevents abuse by limiting number of requests a user can make in a given time frame.
- **Data encryption:** Encrypts sensitive data in transit (using HTTPs) and at rest.
- **Input validation:** Sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection and other types of attacks.

    ### IMPORTANCE
    - Protects user data by ensuring the personal information and credential of users are secure.
    - Prevents fraud and safeguards payment information.
    - Ensures users trust the application and use it confidently.
    - Rate limiting and input validation prevent abuse by malicious users.

## CI/CD PIPELINE
   *CI/CD* pipelines are automated workflows that handle the continuous integration of code changes and their continuous delivery/deployment to production environments.They ensure code is tested, built and deployed reliably and quickly.
   
   ### Tool:
  - *Github Actions:* Used for automating workflows directly from Github
  - *Docker:* Ensures consistent environments across development, testing and production.
  - *Jenkins:* Is a tool used for automating build and deployment pipeline.
